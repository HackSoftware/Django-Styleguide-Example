    The general idea is the following:

    1. We show the toolbar if we have it installed & we have it configured to be shown.
        - This opens up the option to move the dependency as a local one, if one chooses to do so.
    2. This function acts as the single source of truth of that.
        - No additional checks elsewhere are required.

    This means we can have the following options possible:

    - Show on a production environments.
    - Exclude the entire dependency from production environments.
    - Have the flexibility to control the debug toolbar via a single Django setting.

    Additionally, we don't want to deal with the INTERNAL_IPS thing.
