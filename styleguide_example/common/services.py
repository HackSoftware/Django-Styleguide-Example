    """
    Generic update service meant to be reused in local update services.

    For example:

    def user_update(*, user: User, data) -> User:
        fields = ['first_name', 'last_name']
        user, has_updated = model_update(instance=user, fields=fields, data=data)

        // Do other actions with the user here

        return user

    Return value: Tuple with the following elements:
        1. The instance we updated.
        2. A boolean value representing whether we performed an update or not.

    Some important notes:

        - Only keys present in `fields` will be taken from `data`.
        - If something in present in `fields` but not present in `data`, we simply skip.
        - There's a strict assertion that all values in `fields` are actual fields in `instance`.
        - `fields` can support m2m fields, which are handled after the update on `instance`.
        - If `auto_updated_at` is True, we'll try bumping `updated_at` with the current timestmap.
